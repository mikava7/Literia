# LITERIA

LITERIA is a learning project that showcases data fetching and state management in React.
The app fetches data from three different APIs for quotes, stories, and poems.
It displays a random entity from all three categories on the home page,
and has separate categories on the navbar for each API.
In addition, LITERIA has a "Favorites" category where users can store their favorite poems or stories.
The app uses React Context for state management and styled-components for styling.
Axios is used for data fetching and the "react-multi-carousel" package is used for displaying carousels.
